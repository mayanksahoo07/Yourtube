## Project Description

Yourtube is a decentralized live & video streaming platform in the Metaverse. <br />
It allows users to create or watch live streams in a Mobile App, Website Platform and Metaverse world, while rewarding them from every minute they spend on the platform.<br />

We are building this platform to solve many problems in the video sharing and live streaming sectors such as censorship, data collection and targeted advertisement. All of the data and media files uploaded in our platform are stored in IPFS network.

## Value

Having a large number of in game asset & video NFTs, a large amount of video storage, and having our website with hundreds of thousands of website visits will greatly increase the use of both IPFS and the Polygon blockchain, generating more revenue for both ecosystems. <br />

Yourtube aims to be a mix of Youtube & Twitch for Web3 with more features, improvements and a Metaverse world. There are many risks and there is over 80% chance that we or any project on web3 will achieve the level of success we are aiming for, but we plan to stay lean until we find our product fit with the market, iterate frequently and survive long enough. until we reach the inflection point. The benefits of obtaining this right will be huge for the filecoin ecosystem and the web3 ecosystem as a whole.
